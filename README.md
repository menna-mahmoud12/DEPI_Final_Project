# Supplier Quality Analysis Project

This repository contains the final project for the *Data Analyst Specialist Track*, aimed at evaluating supplier quality and plant performance to enhance supply chain efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project addresses key aspects of supplier and plant performance:

- *Data Cleaning*: Preparing raw supplier data for analysis.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Identifying trends, correlations, and actionable insights.
- *Visualization*: Interactive Tableau dashboard for clear and intuitive exploration.
- *Reporting*: Delivering comprehensive findings and recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Key Goals

1. *Identify* top-performing and underperforming suppliers.
2. *Analyze* defect trends across products, plants, and suppliers.
3. *Develop* data-driven strategies to optimize supply chain processes.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- *📓 Notebook*: Final Project - Python Notebook.ipynb
  - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.
  - Visualizations and statistical analyses for defect and downtime metrics.

- *📊 Dashboard*: Final Project - Dashboard.twbx
  - Interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing key findings.

- *📄 Report*: Final Project - Report.pdf
  - Comprehensive report with insights and recommendations.

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- *Defect Trends*: Suppliers with defect rates >5% caused delays and increased costs.
- *High-Risk Categories*: Mechanical and Packaging categories showed the highest defect rates.
- *Plant Performance*: The Detroit plant had the highest defects, peaking in October.
- *Seasonal Insights*: Defects spiked mid-year and in Q4 due to seasonal factors.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- *Prioritize top-performing suppliers* with defect rates <1%.
- Implement stricter *quality control* for high-risk categories.
- Address *plant-specific issues*, especially in Detroit.
- Use *predictive analytics* to monitor supplier performance proactively.
